# BACKGROUND

## Summary

This protocol is for amplifying the 16S rRNA v4-v5 region. The primers (forward: 515F-Y, reverse: 926R) were first presented in [Parada et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.13023) with 515-Y modified from [Quince et al. 2011](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-12-38). We note these are identical primers to those used by the [NOAA CalCOFI Ocean Genomics Program](https://www.protocols.io/view/amplicon-library-preparation-bmuck6sw?step=5&comment_id=130454) and the [Fuhrman lab](https://www.protocols.io/view/fuhrman-lab-515f-926r-16s-and-18s-rrna-gene-sequen-j8nlkpd1g5r7/v2) albiet with a different chemistry and thermocycling conditions than both. We note that the forward primer is identical to the [Earth Microbiome Project](https://earthmicrobiome.org/protocols-and-standards/16s/), but uses a different reverse primer. The target amplicon size is 336 - 486 base pairs.

This primer set targets microbes (e.g., bacteria, phytoplankton, single celled organisms). Important note, this universal primer also amplifies non-target organisms across the tree of life (e.g., invertebrates, vertebrates). 

The protocol presented here is intended as the first PCR of a two-step PCR next generation sequencing library preparation using Illumina Nextera Unique Dual Indices. Our written protocol does not include the second PCR step in which unique library-specific barcodes are attached to each round 1 PCR product.  [NOAA-PMEL-OME-NGS-Library-Preparation-Protocol pending]

## Method description and rationale

This protocol was chosen because it has been widely and historically used by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), a leader in the field of eDNA research and an important partner in the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) and West Coast Ocean Biomolecular Observing Network (WC-OBON), to generate marine eDNA time series. Our protocol uses the same primers, polymerase, and thermocycling conditions as MBARI and MBON. We intentionally chose this protocol to promote standardization of ocean biomolecular observations and easily facilitate integration of PMEL OME eDNA data with MBARI and MBON eDNA time series.

This amplification protocol is accessible to most molecular biology labs.

## Spatial coverage and environment(s) of relevance

This protocol has been used to amplify extracted DNA from thousands of filtered sea water samples taken from Northeastern Pacific coastal stations off the western coast of North America (primarily off California, Oregon, Washington,and Alaska).

## Personnel Required

One person with molecular biology experience.

## Safety

This protocol does not involve any hazardous chemicals, although standard precautions including wearing PPE should be taken to avoid skin and eye exposure to chemical reagents.

## Training requirements

Molecular biology training (including, at a minimum, sterile technique, pipetting small volumes, and programming and running PCR thermocyclers) is required to conduct this protocol.

## Time required to execute the procedure

PCR preparation and running the PCR protocol for a single 96-well plate takes 3.5 hours (210 minutes). Additional plates can be run simultaneously without greatly increasing the time required.

# STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

### Preparation


**Before PCR Setup:**

1. Sterilize workspaces and durable equipment, including pipettes within the BSC with 10% bleach. Then wipe down all surfaces and equipment with 70% EtOH.
4. If you have a UV crosslinker available, UV pipettes and tube racks regularly for 2 minutes. [NOAA-PMEL-OME-Sterilization-Protocol pending] 
5. Run the UV light in the BSC for 30 minutes before starting work.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

*Note: When possible, PCR set-up should be carried out in a separate pre-PCR space that is distinct from where the post-PCR space where thermocyclers are located and all post-PCR processing is performed. No equipment, consumables, or reagents should be shared between pre- and post-PCR spaces with a unidirectional flow of sample processing.*

1. Set out primers and positive control to thaw.
2. Vortex and spin down thawed positive control, primers, and nuclease free water. Then tap/flick AmpliTaq rather than vortexing before spinning down. Thawed reagents should be stored in a cooling block or fridge when not in use.
3. Pool reagents to make final master mix, as denoted in above in reagent mixture table.
4. Set out template DNA to thaw if frozen.
5. Aliquot 23 μL of final master mix into each well of the PCR plate. The plate should sit in a cold block to ensure the reagents remain at a low temperature.
6. Add 2 μL DNA template to each well (See [Protocol Sample Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GiYxSuAibLr0o4OulZFxdJbhuhW9fhLBwIDK_UkXR90/edit?usp=sharing)), but reserve two wells for the positive control and a no template control (NTC). 
8. To one well each, add 2 μL of the positive control and 2 μL of nuclease-free water for the NTC.
9. Seal the PCR plate with foil.
10. Spin down the plate, and then transport in cooler blocks before placing in thermocycler.
14.  Run thermocycler protocol.


## Quality control

1. Plates should be removed from the thermocycler  after the run completes and stored at 4°C until run on a gel. Storing the PCR product at -20˚C is ideal for 1-6 month term storage, while -80˚C is ideal for long-term storage.
2. Run gel visualization to confirm successful PCR. [NOAA-PMEL-OME-GelVisualization-Protocol pending]

**Positive Control**

A positive control is used in every PCR run to verify success of the PCR reaction. In place of template DNA, 2 μL of positive control diluted to 10^3 copies/µL is used. One well per plate is alotted for the positive control. The positive control used for 16S is Dromedary camel (*Camelus dromedarius*). The reference mitogenome used to develop the positive control sequence can be found on GenBank: [Accession OP378546.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/OP378546.1). We note that this accession had 2 mismatches in the forward primer as well as 1 mistmatch in the reverse primer and thus we modified the positive control to use the exact primer sequence to avoid mismatches.

**Negative Control**

Nuclease-free water is used as a no template control (NTC) when setting up each PCR plate. One well per plate is alloted to a NTC. NTCs should be run in addition to both field blanks and extraction blanks.

## Basic troubleshooting guide

**Issue 1**: Streaking is observed for sample wells in gel but positive control band appears normal. 

**Solution**: Dilute the sample DNA to a 1:10 dilution with nuclease-free water. If smearing is still observed using a 1:10 dilution, dilute the DNA samples further to a 1:100 dilution. If the samples do not amplify under these conditions the sample likely is inhibited or has too little target DNA and thus is unlikely to yield valuable results. Alternative solutions include cleaning DNA extractions with a commercial clean up kit.

**Issue 2**: No bands were observed in the PCR, including the positive control.

**Solution**: The PCR likely failed. Check reagents to confirm they were not mishandled or expired and rerun the PCR. If positive control fails again, reagents or positive control are likely compromised. 

**Issue 3**: Band observed in no template control.

**Solution**: The PCR was likely contaminated. Sterilize lab space thoroughly and rerun with new aliquots of reagents.

| Field blank  | Sampling negative control. Typically distilled or reverse osmosis water run through a filter like an seawater eDNA sample to control for contamination in the field sampling step.  |
| Extraction blank  | Extraction negative control. Typically nuclease-free water or empty filter run through the DNA extraction process to control for contamination in the DNA extraction step.  |
| No template control | PCR negative control. Typically nuclease-free water loaded in place of a sample on a PCR to control for contamination in the PCR step. |
| Positive control  | PCR positive control. Typically a synthetic DNA strand, non-indigenous DNA extract, or intentionally designed mock community loaded in place of a sample on a PCR to control for contamination and index hopping in the PCR step. |
